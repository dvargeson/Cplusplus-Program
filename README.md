# Cplusplus-Program

1. The task of the project was to create a program that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. We were to use classes and functions to produce the right output for the user. The user would be prompted to enter initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest, and number of years. 
2. Honestly I think I did a pretty good job getting the program to run with the muliple files. I had know trouble splitting up the classes and the header file.
3. I could have used a different method in taking in user input for button pressing. I don't check if the user pressed the right button. I used an if statement to check for a number and not a buttonpress. I could have made a more efficient menu function.
4. I a little trouble programming the math. It's not because I struggle with visualizing the math it's because I try to solve it all at once. After I wrote it out I figured it out. I have added writing pseudocode to my support network.
5. Honestly I would say learning how to write programs that use multiple files is definitly a good skill to have. Some programs need to be split up into more than one file. 
6. I made my program mantainable, readable and adaptable with comments and proper indentation. I tried my best to make it look neat and as understandable as I could.
